<h2>1.)What is assumed as the ultimate source of the energy?<br>=)Sun</h2>
<h2>2.)How much solar energy is received by every square meter of the earth per second at day time?<br>=)1.4 kw. </h2>
<h2>3.)Which is the most suitable energy source for the nepal?<br>=)Hydropower.</h2>
<h2>4.)On which principle is the hydrogen bomb based?<br>=)nuclear fusion.</h2>
<h2>5.)Define renewable source of energy?<br>=)
The sources of energy which can be reproduced in short time and can be used continuosly for a long long time are called renewable source of energy. </h2>

<h1 class="ro">SHORT QUESTION</h1>
<h2>1.)What are the advantage of solar energy over fossil fuel enery.<br>=)<br>a.)Reduces Electricity Bills.<br>b.)Low maintenance costs.</h2>
<h2>2.)What is nuclear energy?
    <br>=)The energy released in a nuclear reaction in which one nuclear transforms into another nucleus is called nuclear energy.
</h2>
<h2>3.)What do the symbols stand for the relation E=mc"2.<br>=)The symbols E=mc"2 stand for:<br>E=energy released<br>
m=mass loss of nucleus converted into energy.<br>c"2=velocity of light in vaccum.</h2>
<h2>4.)What is meant by energy Crisis?<br>=)The future scarcity of energy sources on the earth due to over population, urbanization and  industrialization is called energy crisis.</h2>
<h2>5.)Difference between Renewable resources and Non-renewable resources.<br>=)<br>
