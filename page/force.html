        <h2>1.)Define gravitational force?<br>
        =)The force of attraction between any two bodies toward its center in this universe is known as gravitational force.</h2>
      <h2>2.)Define acceleration due to gravity?<br>
    =)The acceleration produced in a freely falling body  due to gravitational force of the earth is called the acceleration due to gravity.</h2>
    <h2>3.)State Newtons Universal law of gravitation.<br>

        <h2>6.)What is free fall?<br>
            =)When an object is falling towards the surface of the earth only under the gravitational force without any external resistance, the fall of the object is called free fall.</h2>
<h2>7.)Write any two factors on which gravitational force depend?<br>

<div class="ok">
    <h2>1.)What is the main conclusion of coin(guinea) and feather experimnent?<br>
    =)The main conclusion of coin(guinea) and feather experiment  is it was concluded that if there is no air resistance, the acceleration 
produced in the freely  falling objects is same and does not depend on the masses of the falling objects.</h2>
<h2>2.)Why is Newtons Law of gravitational constant called universal Law?<br>
=)The value of G does not depend upon masses of bodies, distance between the bodies, nature of medium, shape, size of the bodies and its nature so, it is called universal gravitational constant. </h2>

<h2>3.)Under what condition do a feather and an iron ball fallk at the same rate? Why?<br>
=)If there is no air resistance, in this condition  a feather and an iron ball fall mat6 the same rate because In this condition, the acceleration

<h1 class="ro">LONG QUESTION</h1>
<div class="ok">
    <h2>1.)What happens to the weight of an object when it is taken from Earth to the Moon?<br>
    =)The weight of an objects is six times greater when it is taken from earth to the moon because the value of acceleration due to gravity on moon is six times smaller 
then earth and  we known that from the second Law of motion the relation between weight and acceleration due to gravity is directly proportional to each other. </h2>
<h2>2.)Prove that the acceleration due to gravity is independent to the mass of falling body.<br>
=)Lets, mass of any planet or satellite be M and its radius be R and mass of an object m, then according to the law of gravitational,<br>
F = GMm/R"2.<br>
mg=GMm/R"2.(according to the Newton's second law of motion, w=mg.)<br>
or,g=GM/R"2.<br>
Thus, aaceleration due to gravity is independent to the mass of the falling body but It depends on the mass and radius of planet.
</h2>
<h2>3.)Two heavenly bodies having mass 'm1' and 'm2' are seperate by distance 'd'. what happen <br>
a.)If the masses of both the bodies are double keeping the distance between them constant?<br>
According to the law of gravitational,<br>
<br>F = Gm1m2/d"2.<br><br>
Now, A/C to the question new force is,<br><br>
F new =G2m1*2m2/d"2.<br><br>
F' = 4* Gm1*m2/d"2.<br><br>
therefore,Fn=4F.<br><br>
hence, the force of gravitation(F) will be increased by four times.</h2>
<h2>4.)Calculate the gravitational force in between two objects of mass 25kg and 20kg if distance between them is 5m.<br>
=)<br>
solution:here;<br><br>
Mass of body (m1)=25kg.<br>Mass of another body(m2)=20kg<br>Distance(d)=5m<br>
Gravitational force(f)=?<br>
By using formula,<br>
f=Gm1m2/d"2<br>
=6.67*10"-11*25*20/(5)"2<br>
=6.67*10"-11*5*10"2/(5)"2<br>
=33.35*10"-9/25<br>
=1.33*10"-9N<br>
hence,TRhe gravitational force between two given objects is 1.33*10"-9N.Ans
=</h2>
<h2>5.)Mass of the sum is 2*10"30 kg and that of the earth is 6*10"24 kg and the distance between them is 1.5*10"11m. what is the gravitational forace produced between them?<br>
<br>=)<br>
solutional:here;<br><br>
Mass of the sun(m1)=2*10"30 kg.<br>
Mass of nthe earth(m2)=6*10"24 kg.<br>
Distance between them(d)=1.5*10"11m.<br>
Gravitational constant(G)=6.67*10"-11.<br>
gravitational force(g)=?<br>
By using formula<br>
f=Gm1m2/d"2.<br>
=6.67*10"-11 *2*10"30*6*10"24/(1.5*10")2<br>
=6.67*2*6*10"-11+30+24/(1.5*10"11)"2.<br>
=80.04*10"43/2.25*10"22<br>
=35.57*10"43-22<br>
=3.557*10"22N.
<br><br>
hence,The gravitational force between sun and earth is 3.557*10"22.</h2>
<h2>6.)Mass and the radius of the moon are 7.2*10"22 kg and 1.7*10"3 km respectively. Calculate the accleratio0n due to gravity of the moon and the weight of a man of mass 70kg on the moon?<br><br>=)
<br><br>
solution:here;
mass of the moon(M)=7.2*10"22 kg.<br>
Radius ofthe moon(R)=1.7*10"3 km <br>
    =1.7*10"6 m.<br>
mass of the man(m)=70kg.<br>Acceleration due to gravity onthe moon(g)=?<br>
weight nof a man(w)=?<br>
By using formiula,<><br>
g=GM//R"2<br>
=6.67*10"-11*7.2*10"22/(1.7*10"6)"2<br>
=6.67*7.2*10"22-11/2.89*10"12<br>
=48.024*10"11/2.89*10"12<br>
=16.61*10"11-12<br>
=16.61*10"-1<br>
here,g=1.66m./s"2.<br>
Again,<br>
weight of a man = m*g<br>
=70*1.66<br>
=116.2N<br>
Hence,The accxeleration due to gravity of the moon is 1.6m/s"2 and The weight of a man is 116.2N.</h2>
<h2>7.)Mass of the earth is 6*20"24 kg and the its radius is 6400km. What is the mass of a man weighting 977N?<br>
    =)solution:here;<br>
    Mass of the earth(M)=6*10"24 kg.<br>
    Radius of the earth(R)=6400km<br>
    =6400000m.<br>
    weight of a manb(w)=977N.<br>
    Mass of a man(m)=?<br>
    we know that,<br>
    Acceleration due to gravity(g)=GM/R"2.<br>
    =6.67*10"-11*6*10"24/(6400000)"2.<br>
    =40.02*10"13/4.09*10"13<br>
    g=9.78 m/s"2<br>
    Now,By using the formula of weight,<br>
    or,w=mg<br>
    or,977=m*9.78<br>
    therefor,m=977/9.78<br>
    =99.89 kg<br>
    Hence,The mass of as man is 99.90 kg.
