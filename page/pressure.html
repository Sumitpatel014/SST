                <h2>1.)State Pascals Law.<br>
                =)Pascals law states that the pressure exerted at any point in an enclosed liquid, is tranmitted equally in all direction throughout the liquid.</h2>
                <h2>2.)Write any four applications of pascals law.<br>
                =)a)Hydraulic press.<br>
            b)Hydraulic brakes.<br>
        c)Hydraulic jack<br>d)Hydraulic lift</h2>
        <h2>3.)Define pressure?<br>
        =)The normal force act on per unit area of surface is known as pressure.</h2>
        <h2>4.)What is upthrust?<br>
        =)Thus, when a body partially or completely immersed in liquid , an upward force acts on it which is callked upthrust.</h2>
        <h2>5.)What is the relation between density of liquid and its upthrust?<br>
        =)The relation between density of liquid and its upthrust is directly proportional to each other.</h2>
        <h2>6.)State law of flotation.<br>
        =)The law of flotation states that, when a body floats in a liquid it displaces the liquid whose weight is equal to its own weight. </h2>
        <h2>7.)State Archimedes principle.<br>
        =)Archimede principle states, when a body is immersed partially or completely  in a liquid , it experiences an upthrust which is equal to the weight of liquid displaced.</h2>
<h2>8.)Write the unit of pressure?<br>=)<br>a.)pascal<br>b.)mm of hg<br>c.)N/m"2.</h2>
<h2>9.)Write the name of the device which is used to measure the atmospheric pressure?<br>=)Barometer</h2>
<h2>10.)What is the normal atmospheric pressure?<br>=)The normal atmospheric pressure are given  below:-<br>
=)a.)760mm of Hg<br>b.)1.01*10"5 Pa.</h2><br><br>

<h2>
<br>1.)What is hydraulic lift?<br>=)The pascal's  law based simple machine which is used in the garage for lift heavy vechicles such as cars,  trucks, bus and box of train etc is known as hydraukic lift.

<h2>4.)We experience nose bleeding while trekking to high altitude why?<br>=)In a high altitude the atmosphere pressure is highly reduced, the net outward pressure in our body becomes so high, this is causes the nose bleeding while trekking to high altitude.

<h2>5.)The piece of ice float on water. Give reason.<br>=)
The sinking and floating of a substance depends on density of substance and the density of liquid, we know that the density of ice is slightly less than the density of water, Therefore, the piece of ice is float on water.</h2>
<h2>6.)Why is it easier to swim in sea than in a pond or river ? <br>=)The density of sea water is greater than pond and river water so, the value of upthrust is greater in sea water than pond and river water therefore, its make easy to swim in sea water than pond  and river water. </h2>

<h2>1.)Describe the working mechanism of a common hand pump.<br>=) A water pump consists of a piston with handle , a barrel, a metal pipe. The piston with handle moves
upand down in the barrel. It is provided with a piston valve which opens when piston moves down and closes when piston moves 
up. The pipe is fitted at the bottom of the barrel goes to the water reservoir. Another valve (foot valve )
is provided at the bottom of the barrel, which opens when the piston moves up and it gets closed when the piston moves down and water comes out . </h2>
